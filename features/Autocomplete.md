# Autocomplete

Autocomplete provides inline code suggestions as you type. It provides real-time, inline code suggestions as you type, helping you write code faster and with fewer errors. As you begin typing, it predicts and displays context-aware completions directly. This feature enhances productivity by reducing repetitive typing and offering intelligent suggestions based on your current code and project context.
