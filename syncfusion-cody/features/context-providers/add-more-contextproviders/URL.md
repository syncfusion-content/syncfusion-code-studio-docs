# @URL Context Feature Overview
 
The @URL context option in Syncfusion Code Studio allows you to bring content from a web page directly into your conversation with the AI. By processing the page's information, the AI provides more accurate and relevant responses based on the linked content.
 
## How to Use the @URL Context
 
### Open the Syncfusion Code Studio
 
In the Syncfusion Code Studio, the chat interface is located on the left-hand side. This is where you can interact with AI and ask questions or get assistance.
