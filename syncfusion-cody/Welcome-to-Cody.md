# Welcome to Syncfusion code studio

Syncfusion code studio is a next-generation AI-powered Integrated Development Environment (IDE), designed to supercharge developer productivity. With built-in AI assistance, Syncfusion code studio understands your codebase, provides context-aware suggestions, and automates tasks such as UI generation, bug fixing, and documentation â€” all while keeping developers in control.

Deeply integrated with Syncfusion's rich component library, Syncfusion code studio empowers teams to build robust, scalable applications with speed and precision.

## Key Features
- **Autocomplete Mode**: AI-powered code suggestions as you type, based on your current project
- **Chat Mode**: Ask questions, generate code, or get explanations through natural language.
- **Agent Mode**: The AI agent understands your codebase and autonomously performs multi-step tasks. It can read files, reason about logic, and use built-in tools (like file search, code edit, or UI generation) to complete complex workflows end-to-end.
