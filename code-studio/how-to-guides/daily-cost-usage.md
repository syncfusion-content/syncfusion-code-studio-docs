# Daily Cost Usage

## Overview
Daily cost usage and token tracking helps you see how much AI you are using and how much it costs. 
It shows you:
   - How many tokens you used today in total 
   - How much money this usage costs 
   - If your usage is normal or unusual 
   - How you can control or reduce cost 
This helps you save money, improve your prompts, and stay within your budget limits.

##  When to Use
 Use this tracking process when:
- You need to monitor AI usage costs on a daily basis.
- You're deploying LLM-based applications that may generate unpredictable or dynamic usage.
- You want to optimize prompt efficiency or identify expensive operations.
