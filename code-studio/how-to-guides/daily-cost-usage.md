# Daily Cost Usage

## Overview
Daily cost and token tracking helps you understand how much AI you use and how much it costs.
It shows you:
- How many tokens you used today in total.
- How much that usage costs.
- Whether your usage is normal or unusual.
- How to control or reduce costs.

This helps you save money, improve prompts, and stay within budget limits.

## When to Use
Use this tracking process when:
- You need to monitor AI usage costs on a daily basis.
- You're deploying LLM-based applications that may generate unpredictable or dynamic usage.
- You want to optimize prompt efficiency or identify expensive operations.

## Prerequisites
Before tracking daily cost and token usage for activity performed in Code Studio, ensure the following:
- You are logged in to Code Studio.
- You can navigate to the Dashboard from Code Studio.
- You can view the Usage, Cost, and Tokens sections.

Here is what you can track:
    - Token usage across different models you used today (hover over a model name).
    - Input vs. output token breakdown.
    - Total tokens consumed.
    - Model-specific token consumption trends.


To calculate **BYOK** model costs and token usage, select the BYOK option at the top of the dashboard (as shown below) and repeat steps 4–7.
