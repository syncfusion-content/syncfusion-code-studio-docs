# Buy More Credits in Code Studio

## Overview

Credits in Syncfusion Code Studio Enterprise are add-on units that fund AI model usage across your organization. They provide flexibility beyond the standard [subscription plans](/code-studio/enterprise-server/settings), allowing you to scale your AI-powered coding operations as needed. Once purchased, credits are immediately applied to your account after successful payment, and your current balance is visible at the top of the [dashboard](https://app.sfcodestudio.com/dashboard).


## When to Use

Purchase additional credits when:

- Your organization’s monthly AI usage has exceeded the credits included in your current subscription plan
- You want to avoid any interruption in AI model access during peak development periods
- Your current credit balance is running low and you want to top it up quickly

## Prerequisites

- You must have administrative access to the Settings area in Code Studio Enterprise, this access typically available to organization admins.
- Ensure you have a valid payment method.
