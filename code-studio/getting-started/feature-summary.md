# Code Studio Features

Syncfusion Code Studio is a next‑generation AI‑powered Integrated Development Environment (IDE), designed to supercharge developer productivity. With built‑in AI assistance, Syncfusion Code Studio understands your codebase, provides context‑aware suggestions, and automates tasks such as UI generation, bug fixing, and documentation — all while keeping developers in control.

Deeply integrated with Syncfusion’s rich component library, Syncfusion Code Studio empowers teams to build robust, scalable applications with speed and precision.

## Key Features

•   Autocomplete Mode: AI‑powered code suggestions as you type, based on your current project.  
Learn more on the [Autocomplete](https://helpstaging.syncfusion.com:14038/code-studio/features/autocomplete) page.

•   Ask Mode: Get quick answers, explanations, and readytouse code snippets through simple questions in the IDE—no project files required.  
Learn more on the [Ask](https://helpstaging.syncfusion.com:14038/code-studio/features/ask) page.

•   Edit Mode: Use AI prompts to modify source code with previewed changes, letting you keep or undo each edit for precise control and high accuracy.  
Learn more on the [Edit](https://helpstaging.syncfusion.com:14038/code-studio/features/edit) page.

•   Agent Mode: The AI agent understands your codebase and autonomously performs multi‑step tasks. It can read files, reason about logic, and use built‑in tools (like file search, code edit, or UI generation) to complete complex workflows end‑to‑end.  
Learn more on the [Agent](https://helpstaging.syncfusion.com:14038/code-studio/features/agent) page.

Learn more on the [Plan](https://helpstaging.syncfusion.com:14038/code-studio/features/plan) page.

•   Provide Context to Chat: Attach files, folders, code symbols, errors, screenshots, or tool outputs so the AI understands what you’re working on and gives accurate, relevant guidance.  
Learn more on the [Context](https://helpstaging.syncfusion.com:14038/code-studio/features/add-context) page.

•   UI Builder: An AI‑powered tool that analyzes your development needs and automatically delivers targeted UI guidance with code examples, component documentation, and layouts specifically for Syncfusion components. By understanding your project context, it provides precise, platform‑specific assistance instead of generic advice.
