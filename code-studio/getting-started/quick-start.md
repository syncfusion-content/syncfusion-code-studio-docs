# Quick Start Guide about Syncfusion Code Studio

Start using **Syncfusion Code Studio** in minutes and unlock AI‑powered coding that accelerates your development process.


## Overview
**Syncfusion Code Studio** is an intelligent, AI‑powered coding companion designed to make your development process faster and easier. Instead of writing every line manually or searching for solutions, Code Studio works alongside you—understanding your intent, offering meaningful suggestions, and helping you learn as you build.

This assistant supports developers of **all skill levels**, whether you're writing your first lines of code or managing complex enterprise applications.

With the help of advanced AI, Code Studio can:

- **Generate code** for you, reducing repetitive tasks  
- **Identify and fix errors** automatically  
- **Explain your code**, line by line or function by function  

It helps you write cleaner, more accurate code while staying focused and productive.


## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure that:

1. **Syncfusion Code Studio is installed**  
   If it’s not installed, refer to the installation guide to set it up properly.

2. **A local project folder is ready**  
   Code Studio works best with an existing project or a fresh folder for coding.

3. **Basic familiarity with writing code**  
   You don’t need to be an expert—just comfortable editing files and understanding simple programming concepts.


## Step 1: Open a Project in Code Studio

Follow the steps below to open your project and start working inside the Code Studio environment.

1. **Open the application based on your OS**
   - **Windows:** Go to the *Start Menu*, search for *Syncfusion Code Studio*, and launch it.
   - **macOS:** Open *Applications* or *Launchpad*, find *Syncfusion Code Studio*, and open it.

2. **Access the File Menu** - At the top menu bar, click **"File"**.

3. **Select “Open Folder”**

4. **Choose your project folder**

### Result :
Your selected project will open in the editor where you can:

- Browse files in the Explorer sidebar  
- Edit and create source files  
- Use AI-powered features like **Chat**, **Autocomplete**, **Agent**, **Edit**, and **Quick Fix**

## Step 2: Explore Core Features

### Built-in Agent Modes
Code Studio provides five built‑in agents   **Autocomplete**, **Ask**, **Edit**, **Agent**, **Plan** .
You can also create [custom agents](/code-studio/reference/configure-properties/custom-agents.md) for specialized workflows.

### 1. Autocomplete
Autocomplete helps you write code faster by predicting the next part of your logic as you type.

It analyzes the structure of your file, understands your coding patterns, and suggests additions that match the flow of your project.  
This reduces typing effort and ensures consistency.

**For Example:** “When you begin typing a function call”, Autocomplete may fill in arguments, return handling, or common patterns automatically.

### 2. Ask
Ask mode allows you to communicate with the AI using natural language and receive accurate, context‑aware help.

You can request explanations, code examples, best practices, or clarifications for unfamiliar concepts.

**For Example:**  Ask, “Why am I getting an error here?” and the AI will inspect your code, explain the cause, and propose a fix.

*Learn more about [Ask](/code-studio/features/ask.md)*

### 3. Edit Mode
Edit Mode allows you to modify existing code simply by describing the changes.

You can update logic, restructure components, clean up syntax, or improve performance without editing manually.  
Code Studio shows suggested changes clearly, letting you apply or undo them step by step.

**For Example:**  Give, “Simplify this function using early returns,”as pompt, Edit Mode rewrites it neatly while preserving behavior.

*Learn more about [Edit](/code-studio/features/edit.md)*

### 4. Agent Mode
Agent Mode handles larger tasks that span multiple files.

It can plan, update, and refine complex project structures while giving you full control over the process.  
Ideal for scaffolding features, refactoring modules, or managing structured workflows.

**For Example:**  “Set up user authentication.”  The Agent will outline steps, update backend routes, create frontend components, and explain changes.

*Learn more about [Agent](/code-studio/features/agent.md)*

### 5. Plan Mode
Use Plan Mode when you want full visibility before making changes.

Plan Mode creates a clear sequence of steps the AI will follow—helping you understand scope and reduce surprises.

**For Example:**  “Give a plan to upgrade this project to use Fetch instead of Axios.”  The AI will generate an ordered list of required updates across files.

## Inline Chat
Inline Chat allows localized edits directly next to your code.  
Highlight text and ask for improvements, optimizations, or rewrites without switching views.

**Fo Example:**   Select a loop and ask, “Optimize this for better performance.”  
You’ll see improved code inline with **Accept** and **Dismiss** options.

## Add Context
Add Context lets Code Studio understand more of your project by including additional files or folders in the request.

This leads to smarter, interconnected suggestions.

**For Example:**  While editing a UI component, you may add related API client and type definition files so the AI produces improvements fitting your entire structure.
