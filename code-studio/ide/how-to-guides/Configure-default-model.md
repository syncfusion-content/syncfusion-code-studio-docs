# Configuring Default Models

## Overview

This guide explains how to configure default models using API keys (BYOK – Bring Your Own Key) from your chosen provider into Syncfusion Code Enterprise. You'll learn how to set default models for different modes to streamline your workflow.

## When to Use Default Models

Setting a default model ensures that your preferred model appears as the pre-selected option in the model dropdown whenever Syncfusion Code IDE opens or reopens. While you can switch to another model during a session, the default model will be automatically restored the next time you start Syncfusion Code.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure:

* Syncfusion Code is installed and configured on your system. If you have not yet downloaded Syncfusion Code, refer to the [Syncfusion Code Install and Configure](https://help.syncfusion.com/code-studio/getting-started/install-and-configuration)
* You have a valid API key from the chat model provider you want to use (e.g., [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys), [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/dashboard), [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/settings/keys)).

## Steps for Configure Default Models

### Step 1: Open Syncfusion Code Enterprise Server dashboard
