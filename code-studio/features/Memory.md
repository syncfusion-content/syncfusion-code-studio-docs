# Memory

The Memory feature in Syncfusion Code Studio enhances your AI chat experience by allowing the assistant to recall and reuse relevant information from past interactions. This ensures continuity, improves response accuracy, and supports complex or multi-step workflows. Memory is divided into two key components:
- Automatic Memory
- Memory Context Provider

## 1. Automatic Memory
This mode allows the assistant to automatically include relevant past memory in your current query context. It works silently in the background, surfacing only the most relevant information when needed.

### Benefits:
- No manual effort required.
- Seamless continuity across sessions.
- Ideal for ongoing projects or recurring tasks.

## 2. Memory Context Provider
This manual mode gives you full control over which past conversations are referenced in your current session.

### How to Use:
1. Open Syncfusion Code Studio.
2. Click the Syncfusion Code Studio icon in the left-hand toolbar to open the AI chat interface.

6. Choose the memory you want to include in your current session.


Once selected, the memory is added to your context, helping the assistant respond with greater relevance.

## 3. Managing Memories
You can edit or delete memories to keep your workspace organized and up to date. Click on the open settings icon and navigate to the Memory section.

Note: All memories are stored locally on your machine. Syncfusion values your privacy and does not upload memory data to the cloud. 

You can also toggle the Memory feature on or off anytime from the User Settings page.
