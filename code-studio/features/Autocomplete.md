# Autocomplete

Autocomplete provides inline code suggestions as you type. It provides real-time, inline code suggestions as you type, helping you write code faster and with fewer errors. As you begin typing, it predicts and displays context-aware completions directly. This feature enhances productivity by reducing repetitive typing and offering intelligent suggestions based on your current code and project context.

## Steps to Integrate Autocomplete Feature:

**Step 1:** Open your `config.yaml` file by clicking the gear icon at the top of the chat.

**Step 3:** Inside the `config.yaml` file, add `roles` under the model which you are using in the `models` section. Inside `roles`, add `"autocomplete"`.
