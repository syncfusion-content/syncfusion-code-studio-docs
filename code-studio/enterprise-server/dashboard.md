# Dashboard

The Code Studios Dashboard provides a centralized interface for monitoring and analyzing usage metrics across your organization. It enables administrators and team leads to track token consumption, request volumes, latency, and cost metrics, both at the organizational and individual levels.



## 1. Graphical Overview

The dashboard presents a visual summary of the following metrics:

- **Total Cost**: Cumulative cost incurred by the organization, team or individual user.
