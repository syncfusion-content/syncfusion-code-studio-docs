# User & Teams

Code Studio empowers administrators and team leads to manage organization members, assign roles, and organize users into teams for seamless collaboration and governance.

## 1. Key Benefits

- **Role Assignment**: Assign roles such as Admin, Team Lead, or User to match your organizational hierarchy.
- **Team Creation**: Easily create and manage teams with intuitive controls.
- **Usage Visibility**: Monitor usage and spending at both team and individual levels.
- **Streamlined Control**: Centralized management for onboarding, governance, and collaboration.

> **Note**: Only Admins and Team Leads can manage users and teams. Regular users do not have permission to make changes to team or user settings.
