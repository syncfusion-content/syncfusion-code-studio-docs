# Getting Started with Code Studio

## When to Use

Use **Code Studio** when you need a cloud-based IDE to write, run, debug, and deploy code with built-in AI assistance, team collaboration, and pay-as-you-go LLM billing—perfect for single users, startups, or enterprises that want VS Code in the browser without managing servers.

## Prerequisites

- A modern browser:
  - Chrome
  - Edge
  - Firefox
  - Safari  
  *(Latest two versions recommended)*

- Internet connection:
  - ≥ 10 Mbps recommended

- One of the following accounts:
  - Microsoft account (personal, work, or school)
  - GitHub account
  - Existing Syncfusion account

- *(Optional)* Credit card for AI usage beyond the free tier.
