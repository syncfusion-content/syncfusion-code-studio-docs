# Models

Select the right language model from the dropdown menus in each section to optimize your workflow for tasks like chat, editing, or code completion.

## Why Choose a Model?

- **Specialization**: Each model excels at certain tasks—some are conversational, others are optimized for code completion or understanding context.
- **Customization**: Tailor your experience by picking the model that best matches your use case.

## Available Model Use Cases

You can apply different models to the following features:

- **Chat**: Interact naturally to get explanations, answers, or code reviews.
- **Edit**: Generate, refactor, or transform code snippets.
- **Apply**: Execute targeted code modifications with high accuracy.
- **Autocomplete**: Receive smart code completions while typing.
- **Embed**: Produce vector representations for tasks like search or similarity.
- **Rerank**: Improve the ordering of search or recommendation results.
