# MCP Marketplace Documentation

## Overview
The **MCP Marketplace** is a centralized platform for server management, helping users discover, install, and connect the right servers for their needs through an easy-to-use interface. It showcases a variety of available MCP servers. Users can explore server options and configure them for use by simply clicking the **Install** button, which initiates an automated setup process to integrate the server with the Code Studio extension.



## Steps to Install an MCP Server from Marketplace
- Click the **Syncfusion Code Studio** icon on the top right side  to open the Syncfusion Code Studio chat window.

## Filter Support in Marketplace
- The Marketplace allows you to apply filters to quickly narrow down and find the servers you need:

   - By selecting **All**, it will display all the MCP servers.

## Example Usage of GitHub MCP Server

### Step 1: Installation of GitHub MCP Server
- Open the Marketplace tab.
- There you can find GitHub and click install

### Step 2: Provide Access Token
- After clicking Install, you will be prompted to enter a **GitHub Personal Access Token**.
- Enter a valid access token generated from your GitHub account.
- After entering the access token, click Continue to complete the installation successfully
- Help Link for creating a access token : [Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

### Step 3: Select the Installed Tool
- Identify the GitHub MCP server from **Configure Tool**.
- Select the tools you need from the GitHub MCP server and add them.

### Step 4: Formulate Your Prompt
- Decide what action you want the tool to perform.
- Write the prompt in the chat panel.
  Example : 
<img src="../../reference-images/github4.png" alt="marketplace" >

### Step 5: Execute the Command
- Hit **Enter** to run the command.
- The MCP system parses your request and prepares execution.

### Step 6: Allow or Skip Permissions
- The system may ask you to allow or skip execution (for security reasons).

- If you choose **Allow**, the tool proceeds.
- If you choose **Skip**, the action is canceled.

### Step 7: Confirm Branch Availability
- Once allowed, the tool executes the action.
- After that check the **Branches section** in your GitHub repository.
- Ensure the newly created branch (e.g., `exception-handling`) appears in the list.

## Best Practices
- **Clear Service Boundaries**: Keep each MCP server focused on a single responsibility.responsibility (e.g., database, browser automation, API gateway) to simplify scaling and maintenance.
- **Strong Security Controls**: Enforce authentication, authorization, and encrypted communication. Apply the principle of least privilege and maintain audit logs.
- **Resilience & Reliability**: Implement health checks, retries, and circuit breakers. Design for graceful degradation so services remain usable under stress.
- **Observability & Monitoring**: Provide metrics, structured logs, and tracing. Use tools like Prometheus/Grafana for visibility into performance and failures.
- **Developer Friendly Documentation**: Offer clear onboarding guides, versioned APIs, and examples. Good documentation accelerates adoption and reduces support overhead.


## Note
If you want to add a new MCP server, you can request it by creating a support ticket using the link provided below. This ensures your request is tracked, reviewed, and considered for inclusion.
