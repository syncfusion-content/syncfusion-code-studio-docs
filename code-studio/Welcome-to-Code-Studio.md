# Welcome to Syncfusion code studio

Syncfusion code studio is a next-generation AI-powered Integrated Development Environment (IDE), designed to supercharge developer productivity. With built-in AI assistance, Syncfusion code studio understands your codebase, provides context-aware suggestions, and automates tasks such as UI generation, bug fixing, and documentation — all while keeping developers in control.

Deeply integrated with Syncfusion's rich component library, Syncfusion code studio empowers teams to build robust, scalable applications with speed and precision.

## Key Features
- **Autocomplete Mode**: AI-powered code suggestions as you type, based on your current project. Learn more on the [Autocomplete](/code-studio/features/Autocomplete) page.
- **Chat Mode**: Ask questions, generate code, or get explanations through natural language. Learn more on the [Chat](/code-studio/features/Chat) page.
- **Agent Mode**: The AI agent understands your codebase and autonomously performs multi-step tasks. It can read files, reason about logic, and use built-in tools (like file search, code edit, or UI generation) to complete complex workflows end-to-end. Learn more on the [Agent](/code-studio/features/Agent) page.
- **UI Builder**: Specialized tool that provides essential information for building user interfaces with Syncfusion components. Based on your requirements, it returns technical guidance, component information, and implementation context. Learn more on the [UI Builder](/code-studio/features/UI-Builder) page.
- **Enterprise Server**: Centralized administration for organizations, including users and teams, providers and models, budgets, alerts, and dashboards. Learn more on the [Enterprise Server](/code-studio/enterprise-server/getting-started) page.
- **Summarization**: Keeps long chats efficient by summarizing older messages while preserving key technical context. Learn more in [Summarization Feature](/code-studio/features/Summarize).
- **Built-in Tools**: Perform file edits, searches, terminal commands, and more directly from the agent. See [Tools](/code-studio/reference/configure-properties/ToolsSupport).
- **Checkpoints**: Automatically capture, compare, and restore your workspace state to track changes and recover easily. Learn more in [Checkpoints](/code-studio/features/Checkpoints).
- **Memory**: Persist relevant session details and reuse them automatically or via context providers to improve responses. See [Memory](/code-studio/features/Memory).
- **Enhance Prompt**: Refine and optimize your queries for clearer, more effective AI responses. See [Enhance Prompt](/code-studio/features/Enhanceprompt).
- **Ask Code Studio**: Get instant, in-editor AI suggestions to fix errors with context-aware guidance. See [Ask Code Studio](/code-studio/features/askcodestudio).
- **Inline Edit**: Apply AI-powered fixes, optimizations, and docs right from the editor’s context menu. See [Inline Edit](/code-studio/features/Inline).
- **Apply to Current File**: Insert AI-suggested code directly into the open file with one click. See [Apply to Current File](/code-studio/features/Applytocurrentfile).
- **Telemetry**: Anonymous usage analytics to improve product quality; can be disabled anytime. See [Telemetry](/code-studio/features/Telemetry).
- **MCP Integration**: Discover and manage servers via the [MCP Marketplace](/code-studio/reference/configure-properties/mcp/marketplace) or connect [Custom Servers](/code-studio/reference/configure-properties/mcp/customServers) including Remote, NPM, and Local.
