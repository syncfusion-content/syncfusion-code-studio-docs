# What’s New in v1.0.3

# Improvements

## Global Agent Rules
Global Agent Rules are now supported in Code Studio. Introduce them via a plain **AGENTS.md** Markdown file—simply drop it in your project root or subdirectories for easy, readable instructions that guide AI code generation and tasks. Unlike structured Project Rules, this lightweight approach requires no metadata or complex setup, making it ideal for maintaining consistent guidelines across your project without repeating context in every chat.

### Key Notes
- The total lines across all **AGENTS.md** files (including nested and root files) should be fewer than 500 to avoid context length issues.  
- Enable **AGENTS.md** from the settings menu to apply it automatically to all chats.

## Quick Tool Access with # Suggestions in Chat
We've supercharged your chat experience with inline tool suggestions: type `#` to open a dropdown of available tools, select one, and it auto-inserts as `#{ToolName}` followed by your prompt for seamless integration. Building on our `@` context providers, this `#` trigger keeps things distinct and speedy, ensuring consistent tool selection and sharper AI responses by eliminating guesswork. It sends a structured request that enhances response accuracy—no extra setup needed; just type and go!

## Dynamic Subscription Guidance
The Subscription Popup UI has been refined for a more intuitive and adaptive experience. It now features a centralized **"Select Plan"** interface that contextualizes options based on the user's scenario, alongside Premium Plans and Free Options, to facilitate quick decisions. This redesign prioritizes clarity and efficiency, deploying automatically in relevant contexts across the IDE with no user intervention or data migrations required.

## UI Builder Tool Token Usage Enhancement
In this release, we've improved token usage tracking for the UI Builder tool in Context Mode. We now aggregate prompt and completion tokens from its two underlying LLM calls, summing them into a dedicated static property for comprehensive reporting. This ensures accurate isolation, cost calculation, and analytics support for UI Builder invocations. Developers can rely on complete usage data in tool call results for better monitoring and optimization—no changes are required for existing integrations.  

# Bug Fixes
- Fixed an issue where relevant controls were missing from UI Builder's Context Mode responses. The tool now intelligently selects and adds only the most fitting components, ensuring outputs remain focused, efficient, and aligned with your query for smoother UI builds.  
- Now you can select **Default BYOK model** from the dashboard's **Manage Default Settings**. This now flows through correctly, appearing as the default in the Code Studio Extension for a unified AI setup across your tools.
