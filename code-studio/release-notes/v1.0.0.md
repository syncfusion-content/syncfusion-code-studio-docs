- **MCP marketplace and custom servers:** A new MCP marketplace is now available, providing a centralized platform where users can easily discover, install, and connect MCP servers through an intuitive interface. Explore a wide range of available servers and set them up with just one click. Installation is fully automated and integrates directly with the Code Studio extension. Custom server support lets you effortlessly connect any custom MCP server, giving you greater flexibility and control when accessing servers within the Code Studio extension. For more details, refer to our documentation on the [MCP marketplace](/code-studio/reference/configure-properties/mcp/marketplace) and [custom servers](/code-studio/reference/configure-properties/mcp/customservers).

- **Context length optimization:** Implemented automatic summarization to maintain context usage within set limits throughout the session. When the context length approaches its limit, previous user and assistant conversations are summarized to manage resource consumption efficiently.For more details, please refer to our documentation on [summarization](/code-studio/features/summarize).

- **Session spending warning:** A warning message is now displayed to users who exceed $5 in a single session, assisting in cost awareness and budget management.
- **Feedback section:** A new feedback section is available under the help menu in the title bar, linking directly to the Syncfusion Code Studio feedback page.
- **Image and agent mode support:** Introduced generic image handling and expanded agent mode compatibility for a more versatile workflow.
- **Generic new model support:** Introduced a new generic model support in the add chat model option in the user settings. 
- **Tools improvements:** Tools have been updated for greater reliability and flexibility, including the run terminal tool, which now enables the move to background feature only for development commands (with clear tooltips for others), removes unnecessary visual clutter from the terminal output, and executes shell commands more reliably by running them as terminal code. Additional tool enhancements include better handling of multiple file creations, improved accuracy in file and directory listings, more precise searching and file reading, smarter change detection in diffs, and enhanced support for processing specific file ranges and handling malformed input. For more details, refer to our documentation on [tools](/code-studio/reference/configure-properties/toolssupport).
- **Improved indexing performance:** Improved performance issues where local indexing caused the extension UI to lag in larger workspaces. The extension UI now remains responsive during local indexing, even for large projects. 
- **Error handling:** Improved error handling API key issues, request errors and server-side errors. 
- **Improved EACCESS error handling for MCP server installation for Mac users:** Improved error handling for cached EACCESS issues during MCP server installation for Mac users. Added informative error messages with direct links to relevant solution documentation. 
- **Security enhancements:** Enhanced system security by updating the AI system prompt to prevent the exposure of internal system prompts and built-in tool information. 
- **Streaming support for GPT-5 and other models:** Streaming is now supported for high-end models, including OpenAI GPT-5, O1, O3 Mini, and O4-Mini.
- **Bug fixes and performance improvements:**
  - Resolved UI Builder tool execution problems triggered by specific user prompts.
  - Enhanced stability and reliability across all features for a smoother user experience.
