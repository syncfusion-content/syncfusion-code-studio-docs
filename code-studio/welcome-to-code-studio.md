# Welcome to Syncfusion code studio

Syncfusion code studio is a next-generation AI-powered Integrated Development Environment (IDE), designed to supercharge developer productivity. With built-in AI assistance, Syncfusion code studio understands your codebase, provides context-aware suggestions, and automates tasks such as UI generation, bug fixing, and documentation — all while keeping developers in control.

Deeply integrated with Syncfusion's rich component library, Syncfusion code studio empowers teams to build robust, scalable applications with speed and precision.

## Key Features
- **Autocomplete Mode**: AI-powered code suggestions as you type, based on your current project. Learn more on the [Autocomplete](/code-studio/features/autocomplete) page.
- **Chat Mode**: Ask questions, generate code, or get explanations through natural language. Learn more on the [Chat](/code-studio/features/chat) page.
- **Agent Mode**: The AI agent understands your codebase and autonomously performs multi-step tasks. It can read files, reason about logic, and use built-in tools (like file search, code edit, or UI generation) to complete complex workflows end-to-end. Learn more on the [Agent](/code-studio/features/agent) page.
- **UI Builder**: An AI-powered tool that analyzes your development needs and automatically delivers targeted UI guidance with code examples, component documentation, and layouts specifically for Syncfusion components. By understanding your project context, it provides precise, platform-specific assistance instead of generic advice. Learn more on the [UI Builder](/code-studio/features/ui-builder) page.
- **Enterprise Server**: Centralized administration for organizations, including users and teams, providers and models, budgets, alerts, and dashboards. Learn more on the [Enterprise Server](/code-studio/enterprise-server/getting-started) page.
- **Summarization**: Keeps long chats efficient by summarizing older messages while preserving key technical context. Learn more in [Summarization Feature](/code-studio/features/summarize).
- **Built-in Tools**: Perform file edits, searches, terminal commands, and more directly from the agent. See [Tools](/code-studio/reference/configure-properties/toolssupport).
- **Checkpoints**: Automatically capture, compare, and restore your workspace state to track changes and recover easily. Learn more in [Checkpoints](/code-studio/features/checkpoints).
- **Memory**: Persist relevant session details and reuse them automatically or via context providers to improve responses. See [Memory](/code-studio/features/memory).
- **Enhance Prompt**: Refine and optimize your queries for clearer, more effective AI responses. See [Enhance Prompt](/code-studio/features/enhanceprompt).
- **Ask Code Studio**: Get instant, in-editor AI suggestions to fix errors with context-aware guidance. See [Ask Code Studio](/code-studio/features/askcodestudio).
- **Inline Edit**: Apply AI-powered fixes, optimizations, and docs right from the editor’s context menu. See [Inline Edit](/code-studio/features/inline).
- **Apply to Current File**: Insert AI-suggested code directly into the open file with one click. See [Apply to Current File](/code-studio/features/applytocurrentfile).
- **Telemetry**: Anonymous usage analytics to improve product quality; can be disabled anytime. See [Telemetry](/code-studio/features/telemetry).
- **MCP Integration**: Discover and manage servers via the [MCP Marketplace](/code-studio/reference/configure-properties/mcp/marketplace) or connect [Custom Servers](/code-studio/reference/configure-properties/mcp/customservers) including Remote, NPM, and Local.
