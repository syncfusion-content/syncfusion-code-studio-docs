# How to access session history files in the revamped CodeStudio

This guide explains how to view session history after upgrading to CodeStudio v2.0.0+.

## Problem Summary
After upgrading to CodeStudio v2.0.0+, chat sessions from earlier versions (before v2.0.0) may not appear in the session history.

> **Note:** Session history created prior to v2.0.0 cannot be migrated to the CodeStudio v2.0.0+ session history. Refer to the [v2.0.0 release notes](/code-studio/release-notes/v2.0.0) for migration details.

## Resolution Steps

After upgrading, existing conversation sessions created in versions before v2.0.0 may not be accessible.

## Accessing Session History

To view your session history, follow these steps:

1. Click the **three dots icon** (⋯) labeled "View and More Actions".
