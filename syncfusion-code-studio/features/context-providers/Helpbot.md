### 3. Use helpbot Context with Query

After choosing the HelpBot context, you can type a question to get helpful info from Syncfusion’s documentation.

For example, you can ask something like “How to add Title and Content slide in PowerPoint library?” Then press Enter.

HelpBot will search the documentation, retrieve relevant information, and display helpful results, giving you accurate answers based on your query.
